# Design_and_Verification_of_APB_Memory_using_Verilog 
* Designed and implemented an AMBA-APB compliant memory slave in Verilog HDL using a 3-state FSM (IDLE, SETUP, ACCESS).
* Implemented 32×32-bit memory with full APB read and write transactions following protocol timing.
* Integrated address range checking and Pslverr generation for invalid accesses.
* Developed a self-driven APB testbench with read, write, and error scenarios for functional verification.
* Verified design functionality using RTL simulation and waveform analysis.
* Ensured synthesizable, clean, and modular RTL suitable for SoC peripheral integration.
